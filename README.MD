Valthrun_PUBG is an open source external PUBG read only gameplay enhancer.  
That's a lot of descriptive words, but what does each of them mean?  
- `Valthrun_PUBG` The name of this project
- `open source` This application is open source and for everyone to learn from
- `external` We do not inject any DLLs into the target process
- `read only` We do not write to the PUBG process in any way, therefore being impossible to detect by scanning the process memory
